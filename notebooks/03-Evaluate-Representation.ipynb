    "# 3. Evaluate dimensionality reduction results for representing population stratification\n",
    "Here, we sift through the results from the previous notebook to see what dimensionality reduction method + hyperparameter combinations (herein abbreviated as MHC) perform best for \"representing\" population stratification.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are _lots_ of ways we could judge performance here. So this analysis should not be taken as gospel, but rather as just one way of evaluating these results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, for PCA and PCoA, we only consider the first two PCs here -- since we're evaluating how good these results serve as visualizations. (We could also conceivably look at the first three PCs, but the t-SNE and UMAP results were explicitly projected onto two rather than three dimensions so we'd need to rerun things accordingly.)"

    "\n",
    "We don't have a full pedigree for all of the 2,504 samples represented in our dataset -- the best we have is [population information](https://www.internationalgenome.org/category/population/) (e.g. `CEU`). When evaluating a dimensionality reduction method's 2D visualization of these samples, it seems like a reasonable starting point to say that **samples from the same \"population,\" as defined by 1000 Genomes, should generally be located closer together in the visualization.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, if that were our only metric, then a visualization with every sample placed at the same point would get a perfect score. So we'll have to be more specific. We might add on that **samples from different populations should be located farther apart in the visualization.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is (one of the many places) where things get fuzzy. It should be clear that treating each population as \"uniformly different\" from other populations is problematic: as an example, the 1000 Genomes data treats CHB (`Han Chinese in Beijing, China`), CHS (`Southern Han Chinese`), and YRI (`Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria`) as three different populations, but of course we'd generally expect individuals from the first two populations to be more closely related to each other than to individuals from the YRI population."

(We recognize up front our use of HDBSCAN\\* here, then, might bias things towards UMAP somewhat.)\n",
